## Hi there 👋

As a **Senior Architect**, I help 🦸🏻 some of the best organisations in the Nordic region to succeed 📈 with their **eCommerce**, **Customer Service**, **CRM**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Mobile**, **Online Monetization** 💰, **Marketing Automation** initiatives using the Salesforce platform and related technologies, both locally and globally 🌍

With over 20 years of experience, I have solid knowledge of several programming languages and technology platforms, including **Force.com**, **Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud (ex. Demandware)**, **Heroku.com**, **Salesforce Marketing Cloud (ex. ExactTarget)**, **Oracle WebLogic**, **Apache** and **Microsoft® IIS** 👨🏻‍💻

I have strong **leadership and communication** skills, having led and motivated diverse and distributed development teams in various agile projects. I am passionate about architectural design, UI design, web technologies, and continuous improvement. I am always eager to learn new things and to share my expertise with others. My goal is to deliver high-quality, sustainable, and innovative solutions that **create value** for **my clients and their customers** ⭐️

I have also developed several cross-platform mobile apps 📱 and games 🎲 using **Apache Cordova** and deployed them to the **Apple**, **Google** and **Windows** app stores 🛍️.
